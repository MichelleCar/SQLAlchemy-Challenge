### Backgroud
SQLAlchemy is a powerful Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the tools and flexibility of SQL, providing efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

SQLAlchemy provides a “Pythonic” means of interacting with databases, as a kind of universal translator between different dialects of traditional SQL such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.  Developers can leverage the Pythonic framework of SQLAlchemy to streamline their workflow and more efficiently query data.  For example, SQLAlchemy can be used to automatically load tables from a database using reflection, which allows the developer to read the database and build metadata based on that information all written in Python.

In simple terms, You can write a query in the form of a string or chain Python objects for similar queries. Working with objects provides developers flexibility and allows them to build high-performance SQL-based applications. 

In the simplest form, it allows users to connect databases using Python language, run SQL queries using object-based programming, and streamline workflow by working in a single framework.
