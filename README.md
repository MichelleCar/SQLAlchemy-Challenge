### Backgroud
SQLAlchemy is a powerful Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the tools and flexibility of SQL, providing efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

SQLAlchemy provides a “Pythonic” means of interacting with databases, as a kind of universal translator between different dialects of traditional SQL such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.  Developers can leverage the Pythonic framework of SQLAlchemy to streamline their workflow and more efficiently query data.  For example, SQLAlchemy can be used to automatically load tables from a database using reflection, which allows the developer to read the database and build metadata based on that information all written in Python.

In simple terms, You can write a query in the form of a string or chain Python objects for similar queries. Working with objects provides developers flexibility and allows them to build high-performance SQL-based applications. 

In the simplest form, it allows users to connect databases using Python language, run SQL queries using object-based programming, and streamline workflow by working in a single framework.

This functionality extends to the development of web-based applications.  For example, in web applications, you may use a database to store and maintain data that needs to be retrieved and manipulated. You can add data to this database, retrieve it, modify it, or delete it, depending on different requirements and conditions; you can analyze data by creating APIs replete with JSON-built lists/dictionaries. Flask is a straightforward Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications in the Python Language. Combined with SQLAlchemy and Python, Flask allows you to build web apps in Python. Flask provides an easy tool for developers because there is little boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running.

### Case Study Details
Having decided to treat myself to a bucket-list holiday in Hawaii, I don't want to leave anything to chance.  To help with trip planning, I have decided to develop a climate assessment of the area around Honolulu.  This will involve two key approaches:
* Analyzing and exploring the climate data, including precipitation and temperatures across various weather stations across a period of 12 months
* Designing a climate APP to share my results
